Project Description
Industry*:
Lifestyle

Project Title*:
Self Promoting

Problem Statement/Opportunity*:
Creating a personal profile for promoting ourselves will increase our opportunities to be selected in the job sector. Not only for job purpose we can also include our daily activities. If any organizations are willing to give industrial demos, they can contact us by using this profile. We can share our experience with students. Also we can publish ourselves with our own hands.

Project Description*:
Here I created a web page for Self Promoting ourselves without using third party services. By using this we can publish our own activities by our selves in which the full control is in our hands. It consists of Information about the Author, Services offered by the Author, Experience of the Author in different domains, Recent activities of the Author such as vacations, Trips, Functions and so on. Projects done by the author. If the any educational institutions wants the author for Industry sessions for their students, they can contact the author by using contact details. Here I used Visual studio code, visual studio and blob storage for .css files to develop this project. I am using Git Hub platform to deploy my web page.

Primary Azure Technology*:
